# PINKERTON 

inspired by the best weezer album, i make an i3 config to bring everything into Pinkerton colors\

if u want to use this theme in your own i3, u need the next packages: 
  - alacritty
  - i3  
  - dunst
  - polybar
  - rofi 
  - brightnessctl
    
then, paste the config folders into your `.config` folder.
